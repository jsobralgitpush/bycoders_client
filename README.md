## Client Side using NextJs

This repo contains the client side of bycoders application.

To start this project you have to create a folder and put inside of it two subfolders. 
- This one containing the frontend
- [This one containg the backend](https://github.com/jsobralgitpush/bycoders_api)

After this, move the `docker-compose.yml` to the parent folder to build the front and the backend container and run `docker-compose build` to start the containers and `docker-compose up` to build the project
